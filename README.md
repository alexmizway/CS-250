How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
		
	I can interpet user needs and inplement them by using user stories. User stories can help me out with this by allowing ideas from actual potential users to be recorded and added into the program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
		
	I approach development of programs with an agile-like methodology. I mainly use information radiators as my tool but I also use little sprints so that I can test my code with each feature.
	
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

	I personally believe that to be a good team member, you need to be helpful, kind, and a excellent listener. When it comes to software development, I do not believe that there are any other traits needed for a good team member.
